## OpenVINO scripts
This folder contains bash scripts for using OpenVINO, e.g. converting a pretrained model with the model optimizer, inferencing a image on an FPGA, and benchmarking inference speed and accuracy on a dataset.

These scripts are tested with Intel's OpenVINO release R3 (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/OpenVINO-RelNotes). Makes sure to run
```bash
export OPENVINO_ROOTDIR=/path/of/your/choice
```
before running the scripts.
