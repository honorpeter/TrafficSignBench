## Detection
Train VGG-SSD, MobileNet-V1-SSD and MobileNet-V2-SSDLite with Caffe, MXNet and Tensorflow on GTSDB (http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsdb&subsection=dataset) and deploy it on Intel's Arria 10 devkit. 

The support of training models on BDD100K (https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/05/30/bdd/) is under development.

See README files in subdirectories for more info.
